Iâ€™m **Mengnan He**, currently a second year Master's student in Computer Engineering at Northwestern University, with a B.S. in Physics from Tsinghua University. My research interest lays at the intersection of machine learning, FPGA based hardware acceleration and HCI.

I'm currently working in two projects: One researching cross layer resource sharing techniques in neural network implementation on FPGA. And in the other project I work on image segmentation on medical images with a innovative approach based on [MedSAM](https://github.com/bowang-lab/MedSAM).  Previous from that, I have worked on several software applications and interaction designs, with experience in React, Unity and Starlette. Demos are available in my [Portfolio](portfolio).
