# Welcome!

I’m **Mengnan He**, currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Engineering at Northwestern University, with a strong foundation in Mathematics and Physics from Tsinghua University. My academic and professional journey has been driven by a passion for exploring innovative solutions in hardware design and machine learning, alongside a deep interest in robotics and artificial intelligence.

Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work on diverse projects ranging from developing an open-source neural network hardware design automation tool to creating AI-powered applications for real-world challenges, such as humor detection and water meter detection. My research experiences across esteemed institutions, including Northwestern University, Imperial College London, and Tsinghua University, have allowed me to push the boundaries of technology in fields like deep learning, FPGA design, and NLP.

In addition to my technical work, I’ve had hands-on experience designing interactive science exhibits for children and developing AI-powered applications for podcast generation and internet advertising analysis. I'm also actively involved in leadership roles, most recently contributing to the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and student-led initiatives at Tsinghua University.

Feel free to explore my [projects](projects), [publications](publications), and ongoing work, and reach out if you're interested in collaborating or learning more about my research. Let's push the boundaries of what's possible together!
