Humor is a high-level semantic emotion that can only be understood at a stage when the human mind has developed. 
Humor detection is a challenging task in the field of natural language processing. In this paper, we focus on the 
characteristics of humor from the way it is generated and propose the Humor Important Message Attention Net (HIMA
Net): a self-attention network based on the key messages related to humor. Results show that HIMA-Net outperforms the 
traditional models on three datasets (Headline, Pun, Short Jokes), and further analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of 
the proposed model.
